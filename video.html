    <h2> Up Up and Away ~ Video Art</h2>
    <p> This video art consists of an animation with altered music in the background. I chose the Married Life song from the Pixar movie Up. I applied different effects such as echo or invert to change the sounds. I also added a personalized clip of my whistling to the tune. It was difficult for me to add effects to the song since it is one that I already enjoy so much. For my animation I knew I wanted to incorporate the house from Up and created it by printing out the house and blowing up colorful water balloons to recreate the ballons from the movie. I was inspired by puppet like animation and asked help from a friend to move the house along as she wished. To create the illusion of the sky I used a project to project an image of a clodudy sky. At first I did not like the choppy look of the animation, but then realized it reminded me of old family films that one may watch on Christmas looking back at old memories. I imagined the elder couple from Up creating something similar. </p>
